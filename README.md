## Instructions

The TS code is in the `src/index.ts` file.

To be able to run the code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository with the `git clone` command.
2. Open your terminal in the project's root directory (right next to `package.json`).
3. Install the node modules.

```bash:shell
npm install
```

4. To run the code, issue the `npm start` command.

```bash:shell
npm start
```

Alternatively, you can run the TypeScript project in watch mode, so that the TypeScript server is restarted every time you make a change and save.

```bash:shell
npm run dev
```

The `npm run dev` command uses `nodemon` to watch for changes and restarts your TypeScript project every time you save (Ctrl + S).
